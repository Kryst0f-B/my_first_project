Hi,
this is my first attempt at creating my own IT project. I've been learning Python and all essential concepts for almost 6 months and this is the result.

Basically the project should be simple penetration testing tool with TCP/IP SYN DOS attack and ARP poisoning attack. It also contains basic ransomware, which
encrypts files with XOR cipher, because speed of encryption was more important for me than strength of it. It also contains simple dictionary hash cracking
algorithm. All is packed in simple GUI (I now know I shouldn't have done it) made with PyQt5 framework.

P.S. I'll be really greateful for any feedback on what to improve and what to focus on.
